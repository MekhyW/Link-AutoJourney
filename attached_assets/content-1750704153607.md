API for accessing and updating submissions for an assignment. The submission
id in these URLs is the id of the student in the course, there is no separate
submission id exposed in these APIs.

All submission actions can be performed with either the course id, or the
course section id. SIS ids can be used, prefixed by "sis\_course\_id:" or
"sis\_section\_id:" as described in the API documentation on SIS IDs.

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
will be interpreted directly as the score of the assignment.\
Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding\
extra credit.\
```\
\
- percentage\
\
\
\
A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
"40%". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the\
assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100%\
are allowed, for awarding extra credit.\
```\
\
- letter grade\
\
\
\
A letter grade, following the assignment’s defined letter\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
grading scheme. For example, "A-". The resulting score will be the high\
end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if "B" is\
defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of "B" will be worth 86%. The\
letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined\
letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in\
points or percentage rather than the letter grade.\
```\
\
- “pass/complete/fail/incomplete”\
\
\
\
A string value of “pass” or “complete”\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
will give a score of 100%. "fail" or "incomplete" will give a score of\
0.\
```\
\
Note that assignments with grading\_type of “pass\_fail” can only be assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points\_possible, nothing inbetween. If a posted\_grade in the “points” or “percentage” format is sent, the grade will only be accepted if the grade equals one of those two values.\
\
`submission[excuse]`\
\
`boolean`\
\
Sets the “excused” status of an assignment.\
\
`submission[late_policy_status]`\
\
`string`\
\
Sets the late policy status to either “late”, “missing”, “extended”, “none”, or null.\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
NB: "extended" values can only be set in the UI when the "UI features for 'extended' Submissions" Account Feature is on\
```\
\
`submission[sticker]`\
\
`string`\
\
Sets the sticker for the submission.\
\
Allowed values: `apple`, `basketball`, `bell`, `book`, `bookbag`, `briefcase`, `bus`, `calendar`, `chem`, `design`, `pencil`, `beaker`, `paintbrush`, `computer`, `column`, `pen`, `tablet`, `telescope`, `calculator`, `paperclip`, `composite_notebook`, `scissors`, `ruler`, `clock`, `globe`, `grad`, `gym`, `mail`, `microscope`, `mouse`, `music`, `notebook`, `page`, `panda1`, `panda2`, `panda3`, `panda4`, `panda5`, `panda6`, `panda7`, `panda8`, `panda9`, `presentation`, `science`, `science2`, `star`, `tag`, `tape`, `target`, `trophy`\
\
`submission[seconds_late_override]`\
\
`integer`\
\
Sets the seconds late if late policy status is “late”\
\
`rubric_assessment`\
\
`RubricAssessment`\
\
Assign a rubric assessment to this assignment submission. The sub-parameters here depend on the rubric for the assignment. The general format is, for each row in the rubric:\
\
The points awarded for this row.\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
rubric_assessment[criterion_id][points]\
```\
\
The rating id for the row.\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
rubric_assessment[criterion_id][rating_id]\
```\
\
Comments to add for this row.\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
rubric_assessment[criterion_id][comments]\
```\
\
For example, if the assignment rubric is (in JSON format):\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
[\
  {\
    'id': 'crit1',\
    'points': 10,\
    'description': 'Criterion 1',\
    'ratings':\
    [\
      { 'id': 'rat1', 'description': 'Good', 'points': 10 },\
      { 'id': 'rat2', 'description': 'Poor', 'points': 3 }\
    ]\
  },\
  {\
    'id': 'crit2',\
    'points': 5,\
    'description': 'Criterion 2',\
    'ratings':\
    [\
      { 'id': 'rat1', 'description': 'Exemplary', 'points': 5 },\
      { 'id': 'rat2', 'description': 'Complete', 'points': 5 },\
      { 'id': 'rat3', 'description': 'Incomplete', 'points': 0 }\
    ]\
  }\
]\
```\
\
Then a possible set of values for rubric\_assessment would be:\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
rubric_assessment[crit1][points]=3&rubric_assessment[crit1][rating_id]=rat1&rubric_assessment[crit2][points]=5&rubric_assessment[crit2][rating_id]=rat2&rubric_assessment[crit2][comments]=Well%20Done.\

\
`comment[media_comment_id]`\
\
`string`\
\

\
`submission[posted_grade]`\
\
`string`\
\
Assign a score to the submission, updating both the “score” and “grade” fields on the submission record. This parameter can be passed in a few different formats:\
\
- points\
\
\
\
A floating point or integral value, such as “13.5”. The grade\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
will be interpreted directly as the score of the assignment.\
Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding\
extra credit.\
```\
\
- percentage\
\
\
\
A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
"40%". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the\
assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100%\
are allowed, for awarding extra credit.\
```\
\
- letter grade\
\
\
\
A letter grade, following the assignment’s defined letter\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
grading scheme. For example, "A-". The resulting score will be the high\
end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if "B" is\
defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of "B" will be worth 86%. The\
letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined\
letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in\
points or percentage rather than the letter grade.\
```\
\
- “pass/complete/fail/incomplete”\
\
\
\
A string value of “pass” or “complete”\
\
\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\

0.\
```\
\
Note that assignments with grading\_type of “pass\_fail” can only be assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points\_possible, nothing inbetween. If a posted\_grade in the “points” or “percentage” format is sent, the grade will only be accepted if the grade equals one of those two values.\

\
`integer`\
\
Sets the seconds late if late policy status is “late”\
\
`rubric_assessment`\
\
`RubricAssessment`\
\
Assign a rubric assessment to this assignment submission. The sub-parameters here depend on the rubric for the assignment. The general format is, for each row in the rubric:\
\

\
Copy\
\
```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap\
