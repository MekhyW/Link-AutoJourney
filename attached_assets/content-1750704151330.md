Parameter

Type

Description

`assignment_override[student_ids][]`

`integer`

The IDs of the override’s target students. If present, the IDs must each identify a user with an active student enrollment in the course that is not already targetted by a different adhoc override.

`assignment_override[title]`

`string`

The title of the adhoc assignment override. Required if student\_ids is present, ignored otherwise (the title is set to the name of the targetted group or section instead).

`assignment_override[group_id]`

`integer`

The ID of the override’s target group. If present, the following conditions must be met for the override to be successful:

1. the assignment MUST be a group assignment (a group\_category\_id is assigned to it)

2. the ID must identify an active group in the group set the assignment is in

3. the ID must not be targetted by a different override


See [Appendix: Group assignments](https://developerdocs.instructure.com/services/canvas/file.all_resources/assignments#Group+assignments-appendix) for more info.

`assignment_override[course_section_id]`

`assignment_override[unlock_at]`

`DateTime`

The day/time the overridden assignment becomes unlocked. Accepts times in ISO 8601 format, e.g. 2014-10-21T18:48:00Z. If absent, this override will not affect the unlock date. May be present but null to indicate the override removes any previous unlock date.

### [Direct link to heading](https://developerdocs.instructure.com/services/canvas/file.all_resources/assignments\#groupassignments-appendix)    Appendix: Group assignments

The following diagram provides an example to describe the structure
of group assignments. It also shows the correspondence between the
fields of an assignment override API request and the resources they
map to.

![](https://developerdocs.instructure.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3935729257-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FB0qnrcLHZo7GMoCVWI3W%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-9a1a3aca16b86ddd8828faa6b42d00860aac9ca0%252Fgroup_assignment.png%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=467f1288&sv=2)

Group assignments structure example

The components in yellow
are _group sets_. When creating or updating an assignment override,
you will refer to the group set by the `group_category_id` field.

The components in green
are _groups_. An assignment can become a group assignment iff it
has a `group_category_id` that maps to an active group set, as well
as a `group_id` that maps to an active, valid group. In the API,
you will be specifying the group by the `group_id` field of the `assignment_override` construct.

**Important**: an assignment must be assigned to a group set
(the `group_category_id` field) on **creation** for an override
with a `group_id` to be effective.
